All my dotfiles in one place

* Copying
To use, clone the repository and use symlinks for each file.
The default destination location is ~/ or $HOME.

$ `ln -sf .your-config-file ~/.your-config-file`

Some files may be placed under directories such as ~/.config these kinds of

files that must be placed under a destination directory are also placed here
inside the same directory. 

e.g. $ `ln -sf .config/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim/`
